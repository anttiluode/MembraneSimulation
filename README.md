# Membrane Simulation: Emergent Brain-Like Folding Patterns

## **Description**
This Python simulation models a dynamic membrane that exhibits complex, brain-like folding patterns through the interplay of temperature-dependent phase transitions, nonlinear interactions, and coupled quantum-classical dynamics. The visualization includes membrane amplitude, phase, energy flow, and information density, allowing users to observe the emergence of intricate structures reminiscent of neural networks.

## **Features**
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Real-time animation of membrane amplitude, phase, energy flow, and information density.
- **Neuronal Interactions:** Simulates neuronal activations and Hebbian learning for adaptive pattern formation.
- **Temperature-Controlled Phase Transition:** Drives the system from a disordered to an ordered state, enabling complex pattern emergence.
- **Interactive Controls:** Includes an "Observe" button to trigger localized phase shifts and influence energy flow.
